                    “With clarity and definition is associated a certain physical spareness. 
                    Most of the great deciduous trees of England give one the impression, 
                    at any rate in summer, of being rather obese. In Scandinavian mythology Embla,
                    the elm, was the first woman. Those who have lived much with old elm trees—and 
                    I spent a good part of my boyhood under their ponderous shade—will agree that 
                    the Scandinavians were men of insight. There is in effect something blowsily 
                    female about those vast trees that brood with all their bulging masses of foliage
                    above the meadows of the home counties. In winter they are giant skeletons; and for
                    a moment in the early spring a cloud of transparent emerald vapor floats in the air; 
                    but by June they have settled down to an enormous middle age.”
